# Description

A simple game based on React's features. The player attempts to bust as many zombie-faces as possible in the given time. To do so, the player needs to click fast on the zombie icons, which, however, pop up again.
If the player clears the screen before the game is over, the player wins. If there are still zombie icons on the screen, the player loses.
